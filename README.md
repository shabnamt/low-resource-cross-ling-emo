# Low-resource Cross-Lingual Emotion Models and Datasets

This repository contains multiple emotional datasets in the following languages: Farsi, Arabic, Spanish, Ilocano, Odia, and Azerbaijani.
This study aims to build cross-lingual emotion classification for low-resource languages and endangered languages. Farsi, Ilocano, Odia, and Azerbaijani are collected in this study and Arabic and Spanish datasets are borrowed from [Semeval-2018 task 1: Affect in tweets](https://aclanthology.org/S18-1001/).

What do we provide in this repository:
- Datasets in Farsi, Ilocano, Odia, and Azerbaijani (please contact the authors for a copy of the dataset)
- [Emotional dataset in English](https://github.com/shabnamt/jointMultitaskEmo/tree/master/data)
- Cross-lingual and multi-lingual Fasttext w2v aligned for all the languages in this study (please contact the authors for a copy of the dataset)

## Resource Collection and Annotation

This work is focused on building cross-lingual emotion models for 3 basic emotions anger, fear, and joy. We evaluate our methods in 6 target languages: Farsi, Arabic, Spanish, Ilocano, Odia, and Azerbaijani as spoken by a minority community in Iran. These languages are from different language families, typologies, and genres. They are also different in the level of their corresponding resource availability. Arabic and Spanish are moderate resource languages. Ilocano, Odia, and Farsi are low-resource languages and Azerbaijani is an endangered language. More details are provided in our paper.
